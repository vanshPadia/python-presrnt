    Menu Options:
        Add Key-Value Pair: Prompts the user to enter a key and a value, and adds them to the dictionary.
        Remove Key: Prompts the user to enter a key to remove, and deletes the key-value pair from the dictionary if the key exists.
        Print Dictionary: Prints the current state of the dictionary.
        Get Value by Key: Prompts the user to enter a key and retrieves the corresponding value using the get() method.
        Update Value by Key: Prompts the user to enter a key and a new value, and updates the value in the dictionary if the key exists.
        Clear Dictionary: Clears all items in the dictionary using the clear() method.
        Exit: Exits the function.
